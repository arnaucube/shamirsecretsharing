# Shamir's Secret Sharing
> Warning: this has been done to study, do not use.

This repo contains `Rust` & `Go` implementations of [Shamir's Secret Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing) algorithm. A blog post explaining the concepts can be found at https://arnaucube.com/blog/shamir-secret-sharing.html .

The `Go` implementation also has a compiled Web Assembly (WASM) version from the Go code to be used from the browser.

- `go`: [go-shamirsecretsharing](https://github.com/arnaucube/shamirsecretsharing/tree/master/go-shamirsecretsharing): Go lib + WASM lib
- `rust`: [shamirsecretsharing-rs](https://github.com/arnaucube/shamirsecretsharing/tree/master/shamirsecretsharing-rs)
